--   [0] VINIT     dim    := 𐑼               𐑼 → 𐑡  | initial object — ground of distinction
--   [1] TANCH     top    := 𐑡               𐑼 → 𐑠  | terminal object — connectivity boundary
--   [2] IMSCRIB   gram   := 𐑠               𐑡 → 𐑾  | identity — self-imscription
--   [3] AFWD      rel    := 𐑾               𐑠 → 𐑚  | forward morphism — bidirectional arrow
--   [4] FSPLIT    gran   := 𐑚               𐑚 → 𐑚  | split δ — range decomposition
--   [5] EVALT     crit   := ⊙               𐑚 → 𐑙  | evaluate-true — criticality gate open
--   [6] EVALF     chir   := 𐑖               𐑚 → 𐑙  | evaluate-false — chirality check
--   [7] ENGAGR    stoi   := 𐑳               𐑚 → 𐑙  | engage paradox — B-state, both arms
--   [8] CLINK     fid    := 𐑱               𐑚 → 𐑙  | composition — regime coherence
