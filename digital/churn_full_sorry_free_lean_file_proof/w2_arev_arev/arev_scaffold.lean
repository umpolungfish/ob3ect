--   [0] VINIT     dim    := 𐑼               𐑼 → 𐑡  | initial object — ground of distinction
--   [1] TANCH     top    := 𐑡               𐑼 → 𐑾  | terminal object — connectivity boundary
--   [2] AFWD      rel    := 𐑾               𐑡 → 𐑗  | forward morphism — bidirectional arrow
--   [3] AREV      pol    := 𐑗               𐑾 → 𐑱  | reverse morphism — parity flip
--   [4] CLINK     fid    := 𐑱               𐑗 → 𐑠  | composition — regime coherence
--   [5] IMSCRIB   gram   := 𐑠               𐑱 → 𐑚  | identity — self-imscription
--   [6] FSPLIT    gran   := 𐑚               𐑚 → 𐑚  | split δ — range decomposition
--   [7] FFUSE     stoi   := 𐑙               𐑙 → ⊙  | fuse μ — assembly mode
--   [8] EVALT     crit   := ⊙               𐑙 → 𐑖  | evaluate-true — criticality gate open
--   [9] EVALF     chir   := 𐑖               ⊙ → 𐑳  | evaluate-false — chirality check
--   [10] ENGAGR    stoi   := 𐑳               𐑖 → 𐑭  | engage paradox — B-state, both arms
